					<h2 align="left">Thermocrown â€“ Emergency Hypothermia Device for TBI</h2>
					<br /><br />
					<p align="justify"><strong>Market Need:</strong>
					Traumatic brain injury is associated with high rates of mortality and long-term
					disabilities predominantly in the young and elderly. It comes at a tremendous 
					socioeconomic burden of $76 billion in the U.S. Mortality is highest during the
					first two hours and before treatment can start in the ICU. There is a severe 
					lack of prophylactic measures, pharmaceuticals and devices in acute care for 
					TBI.</p>
					<br />
					<p align="justify"><strong>Solution and Opportunity:</strong>
					TBI is time and temperature dependent and hypothermia has been shown to have 
					neuroprotectant effects. Ideal application of hypothermia is within the first, 
					i.e. the &ldquo;Golden Hour&rdquo; of Acute Care, which requires innovative 
					devices, that are portable and easy to use.</p>
					<br />
					<p align="justify"><strong>Thermocrown Product:</strong>
					Our principal product Thermocrown is an innovative hypothermia device for acute 
					care consisting of a flexible and inflatable multi-layer hypothermia cover 
					for head and neck and a small cartridge containing compressed cooling gas. 
					Thermocrown is unique in that it is:</p>
					<br />
					<p align="justify">
					<strong>1.</strong> Effective
					<br />
					<strong>2.</strong> Easy to use
					<br />
					<strong>3.</strong> Designed for EMS and First Aid
					<br />
					<strong>4.</strong> Portable and affordable in large quantities</p>
					<br />
					<p align="justify">Thermocrown is a single-use device and scalable for a wide 
					range of applications.</p>
